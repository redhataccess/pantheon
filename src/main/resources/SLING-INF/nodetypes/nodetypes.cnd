// INTERESTING NOTE:
// There is some "version" keyword that we can add on these types. What does it do? Hmmm...
// Future investigation seems warranted.

// Base type for modules
// nt:hierarchyNode gets us jcr:created - https://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/nt%3AhierarchyNode
// nt:unstructured lets us put whatever properties/children we want - https://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/nt%3Aunstructured
// sling:resource defines the sling:resourceType, not sure if it's necessary since we're doing it manually
//    right here anyways but it probably doesn't hurt for clarity's sake - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SLING/sling-Resource
[pant:module] > nt:unstructured, nt:hierarchyNode, sling:Resource
    - sling:resourceType (string) = 'pantheon/modules' mandatory autocreated
    + cachedContent (nt:unstructured) = nt:unstructured mandatory autocreated


// Base type for titles
[pant:title] > nt:unstructured, nt:hierarchyNode, sling:Resource
	- sling:resourceType (string) = 'pantheon/titles' mandatory autocreated
    + cachedContent (nt:unstructured) = nt:unstructured mandatory autocreated
