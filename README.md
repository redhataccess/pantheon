### Prerequsistes
Docker
Maven
Java

### Unit Tests

```sh
mvn test
```

### How to run this App

To run the application, run the Apache sling docker container.

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name slingapp apache/sling 
```

This will create a container called `slingapp`.

The Sling launchpad can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080` and you can log in to
it using the `admin/admin` username password combo.

To deploy the code used in this demo, all you have to do is run (from the project root)

```sh
 mvn clean package sling:install
```

This will install the code in this project on the running Sling instance, where it can
be previewed and modified.

### What To do once running

Head to http://localhost:8080/pantheon for the application's entry point.

For sling's management UI, you can head to http://localhost:8080/starter/index.html

### How to run against a Mongo datastore

Pull the mongo db image:
```sh
docker pull mongo
```

Run a mongo db container (were are calling it `slingmongo` here)
```sh
docker run --name slingmongo -d mongo
```

Run a transient Sling container which stores everything in the linked mongo db:
```sh
docker run --rm -d -p 8080:8080 --link slingmongo:mongo -e SLING_OPTS='-Dsling.run.modes=oak_mongo -Doak.mongo.uri=mongodb://mongo:27017' apache/sling
```
