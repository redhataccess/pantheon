= Access control list

:context: access-control-list

Traditionally, each file and directory can only have one user owner and one group owner at a time. If you want to apply a more specific set of permissions to a file or directory (allow certain users outside the group to gain access to a specific file within a directory but not to other files) without changing the ownership and permissions of a file or directory, you can use the access control lists (ACL).

The following section describes how to:

* Display the current ACL.
* Set the ACL.
