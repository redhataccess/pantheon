// INTERESTING NOTE:
// There is some "version" keyword that we can add on these types. What does it do? Hmmm...
// Future investigation seems warranted.

// Base type for modules
// nt:hierarchyNode gets us jcr:created - https://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/nt%3AhierarchyNode
// nt:unstructured lets us put whatever properties/children we want - https://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/nt%3Aunstructured
// sling:resource defines the sling:resourceType, not sure if it's necessary since we're doing it manually
//    right here anyways but it probably doesn't hurt for clarity's sake - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SLING/sling-Resource
// mix:referenceable defines an autogenerated uuid
// mix:created gives us created and createdBy fields
// mix:lastModified gives us lastModified and lastModifiedBy fields
