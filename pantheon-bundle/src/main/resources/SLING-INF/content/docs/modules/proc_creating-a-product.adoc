= Creating a product

A product must exist in {ProductName} before you can assign a product name to the metadata of a module or assembly. If the product doesn't already exist, you need to create one.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in.
* You have Publisher permissions.

.Procedure

. Navigate to menu:Products[New Product].

. Enter the following information:
  Product Name:: The text that appears in {ProductShortName}, the document preview, and in user-facing content.
  Product UrlFragment:: This string appears in the user-facing URL for any content that belongs to this product and version. A URL fragment can include letters, numbers, hyphens, periods and underscores.
  Product Description (optional):: A description of the product.

. Click btn:[Save].

After creating a product, you need to create a product version.

.Example

Product Name:: .NET Core
Product UrlFragment:: `net_core`
Product Description:: Documentation for the .NET Core framework.

Entering the above information creates a {ProductShortName} product named `.NET Core`. The URL for documentation that is associated with this product includes `net_core` to identify the product. For example, after creating the product version `4.4-beta` and assigning a module the `*.NET Core*` product and version `*4.4-beta*`, the resulting URL for that module is:

`\https://access.stage.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/topic/net_core/4.4-beta/_module-UUID_`
