= Assigning metadata to {ContentTerm}
:_module-type: PROCEDURE

[role="_abstract"]
Assign metadata to your content so that {ProductShortName} can publish it under the correct product and version on the {PublishingPortal}.

Metadata in modules and assemblies does the following:

* Enables external search engine optimization (SEO) for published content, making it easier for customers to find content.
* Enables (SEO) within {ProductShortName}'s  search engine, making it easier for {ProductShortName} users and administrators to find content.
* Defines the URL at which the {ContentTerm} is published.

[NOTE]
====
Module type is also metadata. You define the module's type directly within the module. See xref:adding-module-types_to_modules_in_Pantheon_assembly-help[Adding the module type to modules in {ProductShortName}].
