= Comparison between modules and topics in traditional topic-based authoring

A module, in {RH}'s modular documentation approach, is similar to a topic in traditional topic-based authoring. The differences between the two are in scope, and application - whereas a topic is a general and abstract concept, a module is a concrete implementation of the abstract concept specific to modular documentation, similar to how a DITA topic defined by the OASIS group is a specific implementation of a topic.

For a topic-based content to be a module, the content must conform to the definition a module as described in Modules.
