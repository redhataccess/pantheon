Check your content for xref validation errors. Invalid xrefs result in broken link when published. 

.Prerequisites

For information on the supported xref forms, see xref:about-xrefs-validation-in-pantheon_{context}[About xref validation in {ProductShortName}].

.Procedure
. Click the {ContentTerm} that has a red alert icon beside it.

If no {ContentTerm} has a red alert icon beside it, the xrefs in your content are valid.
