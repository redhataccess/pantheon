= What is a module

A module, in modular documentation, is defined as topic-specific structured informational content written in the specified syntax, stored in a file, that can be published on its own and as a part of a larger document in {ProductShortName}.

The following are the properties of a module:

* Conforms to the module syntax.
* Self-contained: A module contains all the necessary information about a topic required by a user to achieve a goal. The goal of a user can be to understand a concept, to perform a task, or to find reference information.
* Standalone: A module does not require any surrounding text to be useful to the reader; a module is publishable on its own.
* Pluggable: A module can be used unmodified as a part of a larger document.

Types of modules defined in modular documentation:

* Concept
* Procedure
* Reference
