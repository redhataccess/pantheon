= About Products in {ProductName}

A _product_ in Pantheon is a category that corresponds to a product in the conventional meaning of the word. For example: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a Red Hat product. There is also a product in {ProductName} named Red Hat Enterprise Linux that contains the modules and assemblies for RHEL documentation.

You assign the product name and version in the metadata of a module or assembly. That module or assembly then appears in the search results for that product.

When you create a new product, {ProductShortName} does not allow you to use a product name if a product with that name already exists. Only a Publisher can create a new product.

The value for the product version can be any string, it is not limited to numbers.
