= About Products in {ProductName}

A _product_ in Pantheon is a category that corresponds to a product in the conventional meaning of the word. For example: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a Red Hat product. There is also a product in {ProductName} named Red Hat Enterprise Linux that contains the modules and assemblies for RHEL documentation.

You associate a module or assembly with a product by assigning the product name and version in the metadata of a module or assembly. That module or assembly then appears in the search results for that product.

Limitations:

* Only a *Publisher* can create a new product.

* you cannot create a new product with a product name that already exists.

* The value for the product version can be any string, it is not limited to numbers.
