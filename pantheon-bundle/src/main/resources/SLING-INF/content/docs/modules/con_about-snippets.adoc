[role="_abstract"]
In {ProductName} {ProductNumber}, you can include snippets in modules or assemblies.

A text snippet is a small section of text that is stored in an AsciiDoc file. Text snippets contain content that is reused in multiple modules or assemblies, for example:

* A step or series of steps in a procedure
* A disclaimer, for example, for technology preview or beta releases

[NOTE]
====
A text snippet is not a module, but it is the only content in an AsciiDoc file.
